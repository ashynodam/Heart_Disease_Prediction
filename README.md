# Heart_Disease_Prediction
As a Data Scientist at AIHealth, I developed a model to predict the likelihood of heart disease or heart attacks. This project utilized machine learning to provide early diagnosis and proactive healthcare solutions.

Steps:
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing: Sourced data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Cleaned and scaled features for optimal performance.
2. Feature Engineering: Identified key features like cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and age.
3. Model Training: Employed a Random Forest Classifier, achieving an impressive accuracy of 94%.
4. Evaluation: Used Precision-Recall curves, ROC curves, and Confusion Matrices to validate the modelâ€™s performance.
5. Deployment: Created a web app using Flask for real-time predictions, making the model accessible to healthcare professionals.

Results:
Accuracy: 94%
Precision & Recall: Balanced to minimize false positives and negatives, crucial in medical diagnostics.
Significant Features: Cholesterol, blood pressure, and age were the most influential factors.

Conclusion:
This model holds great potential for early diagnosis, significantly impacting patient care by identifying high-risk individuals early on. Future improvements include incorporating more health indicators, refining feature engineering, and enhancing model interpretability.
